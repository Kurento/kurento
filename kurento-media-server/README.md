# How to use this image

## Start a `kurento-media-server` instance

Starting a Kurento media server instance is easy. Kurento media server exposes
port 8888 for client access. So, assuming you want to map port 8888 in the
instance to local port 8888, you can start kurento media server with:

```console
$ docker run --name kms -p 8888:8888 -d
kurento/kurento-media-server ```

To check that kurento media server is ready and listening, issue the following
command (you need to have curl installed on your system):

```console
$ curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Host: 127.0.0.1:8888" -H "Origin: 127.0.0.1" http://127.0.0.1:8888/kurento
```

You will get something like:

```console
1:8888/kurento
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Server: WebSocket++/0.5.1
```

Don't worry about the second line (`500 Internal Server Error`). It's ok,
because we are not talking the protocol kurento media server expects, we are
just checking that the server is up and listening for connections.

## Kurento media server logs

The kurento media server log is available through the usual way Docker exposes
logs for its containers. So assuming you named your container `kms` (with
`--name kms` as we did above):

```console
$ docker logs kms
```

## Environment variables

Kurento media server exposes an environment variable `GST_DEBUG` that can be
used to set the debug level of kurento media server:

```console
$ docker run -d --name kms -e GST_DEBUG=Kurento*:5 kurento/kurento-media-server
```

## Get help about kurento media server

```console
$ docker run --rm kurento/kurento-media-server --help
```
