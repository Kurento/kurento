Contribution Guide
==================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

The Kurento project accepts contributions from third parties in all kinds of forms:

- Bug reports
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Code enhancements
- Improvements to the :doc:`documentation </dev/writing_documentation>`
- Improvements to the testability of the code itself

The way you can do this is through reporting bugs in the `Issue Tracker`_, proposing changes via `Pull Requests`_, or discussing other topics in the `Kurento Public Mailing List`_.

Kurento team members will probably ask for further explanations, tests or validations of any code contributed to the project before it gets incorporated into its codebase. You must be ready to address these concerns before having your code approved for inclusion.

Please mind the following contribution guidelines:



Did you find a bug?
===================

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching in our `Issue Tracker`_.

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, `open a new one <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento/issues>`__. Include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** that can be used to demonstrate the unexpected behavior.

- For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our `reporting guidelines <https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/support.html#reporting-issues>`__.



Did you fix a bug?
==================

- Open a new GitHub Pull Request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and its solution. Include the relevant Issue number, if applicable.



Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
=====================================================================

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Kurento will generally not be accepted.



Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
=============================================================

- Before contributing a piece of work, we strongly suggest that you first write about your intentions in the `Kurento Public Mailing List`_, so we can talk about the need and value of your changes.

- Specify the contents of your contribution:

  - **What problem is it trying to solve?**
  - **What are the consequences of the changes?**

- Specify the licensing restrictions of the code you contribute.

- By having some work contributed for incorporation in the Kurento project, you will be implicitly accepting Kurento to own the code copyright, so that the Open Source nature of the project can be guaranteed.

- Remember that the Kurento project has no obligations in relation to accepting contributions from third parties.



Thanks for helping
==================

Really, this wouldn't be possible without you!

Kindly, the Kurento Team
