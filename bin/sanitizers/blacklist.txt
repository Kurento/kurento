# ERROR: AddressSanitizer: new-delete-type-mismatch
# in sigc::slot0<bool>::~slot0()
#
# This is a known issue in libsigc++ v2, apparently fixed in v3.
# See https://github.com/libsigcplusplus/libsigcplusplus/issues/10
#
# FIXME: This rule doesn't actually work because ASan lacks the feature of
# disabling it. Feature request: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/58404
#
# NOTE: Blacklist is NOT supported by GCC; you should use Clang or disable the
# check altogether, with `ASAN_OPTIONS=new_delete_type_mismatch=0`.
