;; Local network interfaces used for ICE gathering.
;;
;; If you know which network interfaces should be used to perform ICE (for
;; WebRTC connectivity), you can define them here. Doing so has several
;; advantages:
;;
;; * The WebRTC ICE gathering process will be much quicker. Normally, it needs
;;   to gather local candidates for all of the network interfaces, but this step
;;   can be made faster if you limit it to only the interface that you know will
;;   work.
;;
;; * It will ensure that the media server always decides to use the correct
;;   network interface. With WebRTC ICE gathering it's possible that, under some
;;   circumstances (in systems with virtual network interfaces such as
;;   "docker0") the ICE process ends up choosing the wrong local IP.
;;
;; <networkInterfaces> is a comma-separated list of network interface names.
;;
;; Examples:
;; networkInterfaces=eth0
;; networkInterfaces=eth0,enp0s25
;;
;networkInterfaces=eth0

;; STUN server IP address.
;;
;; The ICE process uses STUN to punch holes through NAT firewalls.
;;
;; You don't need to configure both STUN and TURN, because TURN already includes
;; STUN functionality.
;;
;; <stunServerAddress> MUST be an IP address; domain names are NOT supported.
;;
;; You need to use a well-working STUN server. Use this to check if it works:
;; https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
;; From that check, you should get at least one Server-Reflexive Candidate
;; (type "srflx").
;;
;stunServerAddress=198.51.100.1
;stunServerPort=3478

;; TURN server URL.
;;
;; When STUN is not enough to open connections through some NAT firewalls,
;; using TURN is the remaining alternative.
;;
;; You don't need to configure both STUN and TURN, because TURN already includes
;; STUN functionality.
;;
;; The provided URL should follow one of these formats:
;;
;;   * user:password@ipaddress:port
;;   * user:password@ipaddress:port?transport=[udp|tcp|tls]
;;
;; <ipaddress> MUST be an IP address; domain names are NOT supported.
;; <transport> is OPTIONAL. Possible values: udp, tcp, tls. Default: udp.
;;
;; You need to use a well-working TURN server. Use this to check if it works:
;; https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
;;
;; From that check, you should get at least one Server-Reflexive Candidate
;; (type "srflx") AND one Relay Candidate (type "relay").
;;
;turnURL=user:password@198.51.100.1:3478?transport=udp

;; Certificate used for DTLS authentication.
;;
;; If you want KMS to use a specific certificate for DTLS, then provide it here.
;; You can provide both RSA or ECDSA files; the choice between them is done when
;; calling the WebRtcEndpoint constructor.
;;
;; If this setting isn't specified, a different set of self-signed certificates
;; is generated automatically for each WebRtcEndpoint instance.
;;
;; This setting can be helpful, for example, for situations where you have to
;; manage multiple media servers and want to make sure that all of them use the
;; same certificate. Some browsers, such as Firefox, require this in order to
;; allow multiple WebRTC connections from the same tab to different KMS.
;;
;; Absolute path to the concatenated certificate (chain) file(s) + private key,
;; in PEM format.
;;
;pemCertificateRSA=/path/to/cert+key.pem
;pemCertificateECDSA=/path/to/cert+key.pem

;; External IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the media server.
;;
;; Forces all local IPv4 and/or IPv6 ICE candidates to have the given address.
;; This is really nothing more than a hack, but it's very effective to force a
;; public IP address when one is known in advance for the media server. In doing
;; so, KMS will not need a STUN or TURN server, but remote peers will still be
;; able to contact it.
;;
;; You can try using these settings if KMS is deployed on a publicly accessible
;; server, without NAT, and with a static public IP address. But if it doesn't
;; work for you, just go back to configuring a STUN or TURN server for ICE.
;;
;; Only set this parameter if you know what you're doing, and you understand
;; 100% WHY you need it. For the majority of cases, you should just prefer to
;; configure a STUN or TURN server.
;;
;; <externalIPv4> is a single IPv4 address.
;; <externalIPv6> is a single IPv6 address.
;;
;externalIPv4=198.51.100.1
;externalIPv6=2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

;; Enable ICE-TCP candidate gathering.
;;
;; This setting enables or disables using TCP for ICE candidate gathering in
;; the underlying libnice library:
;; https://libnice.freedesktop.org/libnice/NiceAgent.html#NiceAgent--ice-tcp
;;
;; You might want to disable ICE-TCP to potentially speed up ICE gathering
;; by avoiding TCP candidates in scenarios where they are not needed.
;;
;; <iceTcp> is either 1 (ON) or 0 (OFF). Default: 1 (ON).
;;
;iceTcp=1

;; Enable DSCP tagging for QoS management.
;; WebRTCEndpoints that have this property set to a value different from NO_VALUE
;; will have its output network packets tagged with the corresponding DSCP value.
;; This in turn may make intermediate routers to adapt their traffic handling for those packets 
;; according to the DSCP value set.
;; Recommended values for WebRTC traffic are indicated in section 5 of RFC 8837 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8837#section-5
;; Mainly the following ones, although all other standard defined DSCP value codes can be applied as 
;; currently registered in IANA : http://www.iana.org/assignments/dscp-registry/dscp-registry.xml
;; This feature needs to be managed with caution, as intermediate routers are not guaranteed to support it and also
;; as specified in RFC 8837, some routers may block traffic with certain DSCP values
