JavaScript Module - Crowd Detector Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists of a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a crowd detector filter. This filter detects people
agglomeration in video streams.



Running this example
====================

First of all, install Kurento Media Server: :doc:`/user/installation`. Start the media server and leave it running in the background.

.. note::

   If you will run this tutorial from a remote machine (i.e. not from ``localhost``), then **you need to configure Secure WebSocket (wss://) in Kurento Media Server**. For instructions, check :ref:`features-security-kms-wss`.

   This is not an issue if you will run both KMS and the tutorial demo locally, because browsers (at least Chrome at the time of this writing) allow connecting to insecure WebSockets from HTTPS pages, as long as everything happens in ``localhost``.

Install :term:`Node.js`, :term:`Bower`, and a web server in your system:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower
   sudo npm install -g http-server

Here, we suggest using the simple Node.js ``http-server``, but you could use any other web server.

.. note::

   You need to configure the web server with HTTPS. For more information, check :ref:`features-security-js-https`.

You also need the source code of this demo; clone it from GitHub, then start the web server:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-js/kurento-crowddetector
    git checkout |VERSION_TUTORIAL_JS|
    bower install
    http-server -p 8443 --ssl --cert keys/server.crt --key keys/server.key

Finally, access the web application by using a WebRTC-capable browser (Firefox, Chrome) to open the appropriate URL:

* If KMS is running in your local machine:

  .. code-block:: text

     https://localhost:8443/

* If KMS is running in a remote server:

  .. code-block:: text

     https://localhost:8443/index.html?ws_uri=wss://<KmsIp>:<KmsPort>/kurento



Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a crowd in a WebRTC stream.

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

   *WebRTC with crowdDetector filter Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/tree/master/kurento-crowddetector>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **CrowdDetector** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter.

To setup a ``CrowdDetectorFilter``, first we need to define one or more
*region of interests* (ROIs). A ROI delimits the zone within the video stream
in which crowd are going to be tracked. To define a ROI, we need to configure
at least three points. These points are defined in relative terms (0 to 1) to
the video width and height.

``CrowdDetectorFilter`` performs two actions in the defined ROIs. On the one
hand, the detected crowd are colored over the stream. On the other hand,
different events are raised to the client.

To understand crowd coloring, we can take a look to an screenshot of a running
example of ``CrowdDetectorFilter``. In the picture below, we can see that there
are two ROIs (bounded with white lines in the video). On these ROIs, we can see
two different colors over the original video stream: red zones are drawn over
detected static crowds (or moving slowly). Blue zones are drawn over the
detected crowds moving fast.

   :alt:     Crowd detection sample

   *Crowd detection sample*

Regarding crowd events, there are three types of events, namely:

* CrowdDetectorFluidityEvent. Event raised when a certain level of fluidity is
  detected in a ROI. Fluidity can be seen as the level of general movement in a
  crowd.

* CrowdDetectorOccupancyEvent. Event raised when a level of occupancy is
  detected in a ROI. Occupancy can be seen as the level of agglomeration in
  stream.

* CrowdDetectorDirectionEvent. Event raised when a movement direction is
  detected in a ROI by a crowd.

Both fluidity as occupancy are quantified in a relative metric from 0 to 100%.
Then, both attributes are qualified into three categories: i) Minimum (min);
ii) Medium (med); iii) Maximum (max).

Regarding direction, it is quantified as an angle (0-360º), where 0 is the
direction from the central point of the video to the top (i.e., north), 90
correspond to the direction to the right (east), 180 is the south, and finally
270 is the west.

With all these concepts, now we can check out the Java server-side code of this
demo. As depicted in the snippet below, we create a ROI by adding
``RelativePoint`` instances to a list. Each ROI is then stored into a list of
``RegionOfInterest`` instances.

Then, each ROI should be configured. To do that, we have the following methods:

 * ``fluidityLevelMin``: Fluidity level (0-100%) for the category *minimum*.
 * ``fluidityLevelMed``: Fluidity level (0-100%) for the category *medium*.
 * ``fluidityLevelMax``: Fluidity level (0-100%) for the category *maximum*.
 * ``fluidityNumFramesToEvent``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   fluidity level to rise a  event.
 * ``occupancyLevelMin``:  Occupancy level (0-100%) for the category
   *minimum*.
 * ``occupancyLevelMed``: Occupancy level (0-100%) for the category *medium*.
 * ``occupancyLevelMax``: Occupancy level (0-100%) for the category *maximum*.
 * ``occupancyNumFramesToEvent``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   occupancy level to rise a event.
 * ``sendOpticalFlowEvent``: Boolean value that indicates whether or not
   directions events are going to be tracked by the filter. Be careful with
   this feature, since it is very demanding in terms of resource usage (CPU,
   memory) in the media server. Set to true this parameter only when you are
   going to need directions events in your client-side.
 * ``opticalFlowNumFramesToEvent``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   direction level to rise a event.
 * ``opticalFlowNumFramesToReset``: Number of consecutive frames detecting a
   occupancy level in which the counter is reset.
 * ``opticalFlowAngleOffset``: Counterclockwise offset of the angle. This
   parameters is useful to move the default axis for directions (0º=north,
   90º=east, 180º=south, 270º=west).

.. note::

   Modules can have options. For configuring these options, you'll need to get the constructor for them.
   In Javascript and Node, you have to use *kurentoClient.getComplexType('qualifiedName')* . There is
   an example in the code.

All in all, the media pipeline of this demo is is implemented as follows:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    ...
    kurentoClient.register('kurento-module-crowddetector')
    const RegionOfInterest       = kurentoClient.getComplexType('crowddetector.RegionOfInterest')
    const RegionOfInterestConfig = kurentoClient.getComplexType('crowddetector.RegionOfInterestConfig')
    const RelativePoint          = kurentoClient.getComplexType('crowddetector.RelativePoint')
    ...

    kurentoClient(args.ws_uri, function(error, client) {
      if (error) return onError(error);

      client.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, p) {
        if (error) return onError(error);

        pipeline = p;

        console.log("Got MediaPipeline");

        pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtc) {
          if (error) return onError(error);

          console.log("Got WebRtcEndpoint");

          setIceCandidateCallbacks(webRtcPeer, webRtc, onError)

          webRtc.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("SDP answer obtained. Processing ...");

            webRtc.gatherCandidates(onError);

            webRtcPeer.processAnswer(sdpAnswer);
          });

          var options =
          {
            rois:
            [
              RegionOfInterest({
                id: 'roi1',
                points:
                [
                  RelativePoint({x: 0,   y: 0}),
                  RelativePoint({x: 0.5, y: 0}),
                  RelativePoint({x: 0.5, y: 0.5}),
                  RelativePoint({x: 0,   y: 0.5})
                ],
                regionOfInterestConfig: RegionOfInterestConfig({
                  occupancyLevelMin: 10,
                  occupancyLevelMed: 35,
                  occupancyLevelMax: 65,
                  occupancyNumFramesToEvent: 5,
                  fluidityLevelMin: 10,
                  fluidityLevelMed: 35,
                  fluidityLevelMax: 65,
                  fluidityNumFramesToEvent: 5,
                  sendOpticalFlowEvent: false,
                  opticalFlowNumFramesToEvent: 3,
                  opticalFlowNumFramesToReset: 3,
                  opticalFlowAngleOffset: 0
                })
              })
            ]
          }

          pipeline.create('crowddetector.CrowdDetectorFilter', options, function(error, filter)
          {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("Connecting...");

            filter.on('CrowdDetectorDirection', function (data){
              console.log("Direction event received in roi " + data.roiID +
                 " with direction " + data.directionAngle);
            });

            filter.on('CrowdDetectorFluidity', function (data){
              console.log("Fluidity event received in roi " + data.roiID +
               ". Fluidity level " + data.fluidityPercentage +
               " and fluidity percentage " + data.fluidityLevel);
            });

            filter.on('CrowdDetectorOccupancy', function (data){
              console.log("Occupancy event received in roi " + data.roiID +
               ". Occupancy level " + data.occupancyPercentage +
               " and occupancy percentage " + data.occupancyLevel);
            });

            client.connect(webRtc, filter, webRtc, function(error){
              if (error) return onError(error);

              console.log("WebRtcEndpoint --> Filter --> WebRtcEndpoint");
            });
          });
        });
      });
    });
