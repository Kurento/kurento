Kurento Business Features
=========================

Commercial Support
==================

Kurento is formed by a small team of people. This means that our task pipeline is quite restricted, and most feature or support requests end up being stored in the backlog for a long time. We advance as fast as we can, but time and resources are limited and at the end of the day there is so much that we can do.

If you have some needs that require urgent attention, or want to help with funding development on the Kurento project, we offer consultancy and support services on demand. Please contact us at openvidu@gmail.com and let us know about your project.
