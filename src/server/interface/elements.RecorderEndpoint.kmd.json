<p>
  RecorderEndpoint can store media into local files or send it to a remote
  network storage. When another :rom:cls:`MediaElement` is connected to a
  RecorderEndpoint, the media coming from the former will be muxed into the
  selected recording format and stored in the designated location.
</p>
<p>
  These parameters must be provided to create a RecorderEndpoint, and they
  cannot be changed afterwards:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Destination URI</strong>, where media will be stored. These formats
    are supported:
    <ul>
      <li>
        File: A file path that will be written into the local file system.
        Example:
        <ul>
          <li><code>file:///path/to/file</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        HTTP: A POST request will be used against a remote server. The server
        must support using the <i>chunked</i> encoding mode (HTTP header
        <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code>). Examples:
        <ul>
          <li><code>http(s)://{host}/path/to/file</code></li>
          <li>
            <code>
              http(s)://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}/path/to/file
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Relative URIs (with no schema) are supported. They are completed by
        prepending a default URI defined by property <i>defaultPath</i>. This
        property is defined in the configuration file
        <i>/etc/kurento/modules/kurento/UriEndpoint.conf.ini</i>, and the
        default value is <code>file:///var/lib/kurento/</code>

    <strong>Media Profile</strong> (:rom:enum:`MediaProfileSpecType`), which
    determines the video and audio encoding. See below for more details.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>EndOfStream</strong> (optional), a parameter that dictates if the
    recording should be automatically stopped once the EOS event is detected.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that
  <strong>
    RecorderEndpoint requires write permissions to the destination
  </strong>
  ; otherwise, the media server won't be able to store any information, and an
  :rom:evt:`Error` will be fired. Make sure your application subscribes to this
  event, otherwise troubleshooting issues will be difficult.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    To write local files (if you use <code>file://</code>), the system user that
    is owner of the media server process needs to have write permissions for the
    requested path. By default, this user is named '<code>kurento</code>'.
  </li>
  <li>
    To record through HTTP, the remote server must be accessible through the
    network, and also have the correct write permissions for the destination
    path.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Recording will start as soon as the user invokes the
  <code>record()</code> method. The recorder will then store, in the location
  indicated, the media that the source is sending to the endpoint. If no media
  is being received, or no endpoint has been connected, then the destination
  will be empty. The recorder starts storing information into the file as soon
  as it gets it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Recording must be stopped</strong> when no more data should be stored.
  This is done with the <code>stopAndWait()</code> method, which blocks and
  returns only after all the information was stored correctly.
</p>
<p>
  The source endpoint can be hot-swapped while the recording is taking place.
  The recorded file will then contain different feeds. When switching video
  sources, if the new video has different size, the recorder will retain the
  size of the previous source. If the source is disconnected, the last frame
  recorded will be shown for the duration of the disconnection, or until the
  recording is stopped.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    NOTE: It is recommended to start recording only after media arrives.
  </strong>
  For this, you may use the <code>MediaFlowInStateChanged</code> and
  <code>MediaFlowOutStateChanged</code>
  events of your endpoints, and synchronize the recording with the moment media
  comes into the Recorder.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    WARNING: All connected media types must be flowing to the RecorderEndpoint.
  </strong>
  If you used the default <code>connect()</code> method, it will assume both
  AUDIO and VIDEO. Failing to provide both kinds of media will result in the
  RecorderEndpoint creating an empty file and buffering indefinitely; the
  recorder waits until all kinds of media start arriving, in order to
  synchronize them appropriately.<br />
  For audio-only or video-only recordings, make sure to use the correct,
  media-specific variant of the <code>connect()</code> method.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    When a web browser's video arrives to Kurento via WebRTC, your
    WebRtcEndpoint will emit a <code>MediaFlowOutStateChanged</code> event.
  </li>
  <li>
    When video starts flowing from the WebRtcEndpoint to the RecorderEndpoint,
    the RecorderEndpoint will emit a <code>MediaFlowInStateChanged</code> event.
    You should start recording at this point.
  </li>
  <li>
    You should only start recording when RecorderEndpoint has notified a
    <code>MediaFlowInStateChanged</code> for ALL streams. So, if you record
    AUDIO+VIDEO, your application must receive a
    <code>MediaFlowInStateChanged</code> event for audio, and another
    <code>MediaFlowInStateChanged</code> event for video.
  </li>

  The media profile allows you to specify which codecs and media container will

  Kurento about which codecs should be used.
</p>
<p>
  Watch out for these important remarks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the format of incoming media differs from the recording profile, media
    will need to be transcoded. Transcoding always incurs in noticeable CPU
    load, so it is always good trying to avoid it. For instance, if a
    VP8-encoded video (from WebRTC) is recorded with an MP4 recording profile
    (which means H.264 encoding), the video needs to be transcoded from VP8 to
    H.264. On the other hand, recording with the WEBM profile would allow to
    store the video as-is with its VP8 encoding.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you intend to record audio-only or video-only media, select the
    appropriate <code>_AUDIO_ONLY</code> or <code>_VIDEO_ONLY</code> profile.
    For example, to record a WebRTC screen capture (as obtained from a web
    browser's call to <code>MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()</code>), choose
    <code>WEBM_VIDEO_ONLY</code> instead of just <code>WEBM</code>.

      "doc": "How to fix gaps when they are found in the recorded stream.
<p>
Gaps are typically caused by packet loss in the input streams, such as when an
RTP or WebRTC media flow suffers from network congestion and some packets don't
arrive at the media server.
</p>
<p>Different ways of handling gaps have different tradeoffs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>NONE</strong>: Do not fix gaps.
    <p>
      Leave the stream as-is, and store it with any gaps that the stream might
      have. Some players are clever enough to adapt to this during playback, so
      that the gaps are reduced to a minimum and no problems are perceived by
      the user; other players are not so sophisticated, and will struggle trying
      to decode a file that contains gaps. For example, trying to play such a
      file directly with Chrome will cause lipsync issues (audio and video will
      fall out of sync).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the best choice if you need consistent durations across multiple
      simultaneous recordings, or if you are anyway going to post-process the
      recordings (e.g. with an extra FFmpeg step).
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, assume a session length of 15 seconds: packets arrive
      correctly during the first 5 seconds, then there is a gap, then data
      arrives again for the last 5 seconds. Also, for simplicity, assume 1 frame
      per second. With no fix for gaps, the RecorderEndpoint will store each
      frame as-is, with these timestamps:
    </p>
    <pre>
      frame 1  - 00:01
      frame 2  - 00:02
      frame 3  - 00:03
      frame 4  - 00:04
      frame 5  - 00:05
      frame 11 - 00:11
      frame 12 - 00:12
      frame 13 - 00:13
      frame 14 - 00:14
      frame 15 - 00:15
    </pre>
    <p>
      Notice how the frames between 6 to 10 are missing, but the last 5 frames
      still conserve their original timestamp. The total length of the file is
      detected as 15 seconds by most players, although playback could stutter or
      hang during the missing section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>GENPTS</strong>: Adjust timestamps to generate a smooth progression
    over all frames.
    <p>
      This technique rewrites the timestamp of all frames, so that gaps are
      suppressed. It provides the best playback experience for recordings that
      need to be played as-is (i.e. they won't be post-processed). However,
      fixing timestamps might cause a change in the total duration of a file. So
      different recordings from the same session might end up with slightly
      different durations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our example, the RecorderEndpoint will change all timestamps that
      follow a gap in the stream, and store each frame as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
      frame 1  - 00:01
      frame 2  - 00:02
      frame 3  - 00:03
      frame 4  - 00:04
      frame 5  - 00:05
      frame 11 - 00:06
      frame 12 - 00:07
      frame 13 - 00:08
      frame 14 - 00:09
      frame 15 - 00:10
    </pre>
    <p>
      Notice how the frames between 6 to 10 are missing, and the last 5 frames
      have their timestamps corrected to provide a smooth increment over the
      previous ones. The total length of the file is detected as 10 seconds, and
      playback should be correct throughout the whole file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>FILL_IF_TRANSCODING</strong>: (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET).
    <p>This is a proposal for future improvement of the RecorderEndpoint.</p>
    <p>
      It is possible to perform a dynamic adaptation of audio rate and add frame
      duplication to the video, such that the missing parts are filled with
      artificial data. This has the advantage of providing a smooth playback
      result, and at the same time conserving all original timestamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the main issue with this method is that it requires accessing the
      decoded media; i.e., transcoding must be active. For this reason, the
      proposal is to offer this option to be enabled only when transcoding would
      still happen anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our example, the RecorderEndpoint would change all missing frames like
      this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      frame 1  - 00:01
      frame 2  - 00:02
      frame 3  - 00:03
      frame 4  - 00:04
      frame 5  - 00:05
      fake frame - 00:06
      fake frame - 00:07
      fake frame - 00:08
      fake frame - 00:09
      fake frame - 00:10
      frame 11 - 00:11
      frame 12 - 00:12
      frame 13 - 00:13
      frame 14 - 00:14
      frame 15 - 00:15
    </pre>
    <p>
      This joins the best of both worlds: on one hand, the playback should be
      smooth and even the most basic players should be able to handle the
      recording files without issue. On the other, the total length of the file
      is left unmodified, so it matches with the expected duration of the
      sessions that are being recorded.
