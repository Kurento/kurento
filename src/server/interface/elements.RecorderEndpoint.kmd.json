<p>
  RecorderEndpoint can store media into local files or send it to a remote
  network storage. When another :rom:cls:`MediaElement` is connected to a
  RecorderEndpoint, the media coming from the former will be encapsulated into
  the selected recording format and stored in the designated location.
</p>
<p>
  These parameters must be provided to create a RecorderEndpoint, and they
  cannot be changed afterwards:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Destination URI</strong>, where media will be stored. These formats
    are supported:
    <ul>
      <li>
        File: A file path that will be written into the local file system.
        Example:
        <ul>
          <li><code>file:///path/to/file</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        HTTP: A POST request will be used against a remote server. The server
        must support using the <i>chunked</i> encoding mode (HTTP header
        <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code>). Examples:
        <ul>
          <li><code>http(s)://{server-ip}/path/to/file</code></li>
          <li>
            <code>
              http(s)://{username}:{password}@{server-ip}:{server-port}/path/to/file
            </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Relative URIs (with no schema) are supported. They are completed by
        prepending a default URI defined by property <i>defaultPath</i>. This
        property is defined in the configuration file
        <i>/etc/kurento/modules/kurento/UriEndpoint.conf.ini</i>, and the
        default value is <code>file:///var/lib/kurento/</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          NOTE (for current versions of Kurento 6.x): special characters are not
          supported in <code>{username}</code> or <code>{password}</code>.
        </strong>
        This means that <code>{username}</code> cannot contain colons
        (<code>:</code>), and <code>{password}</code> cannot contain 'at' signs
        (<code>@</code>). This is a limitation of GStreamer 1.8 (the underlying
        media framework behind Kurento), and is already fixed in newer versions
        (which the upcoming Kurento 7.x will use).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          NOTE (for upcoming Kurento 7.x): special characters in
          <code>{username}</code> or <code>{password}</code> must be
          url-encoded.
        </strong>
        This means that colons (<code>:</code>) should be replaced with
        <code>%3A</code>, and 'at' signs (<code>@</code>) should be replaced
        with <code>%40</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Media Profile</strong> (:rom:attr:`MediaProfileSpecType`), used for
    storage. This will determine the video and audio encoding. See below for
    more details about Media Profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>EndOfStream</strong> (optional), a parameter that dictates if the
    recording should be automatically stopped once the EOS event is detected.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that
  <strong>
    RecorderEndpoint requires write permissions to the destination
  </strong>
  ; otherwise, the media server won't be able to store any information, and an
  :rom:evt:`Error` will be fired. Make sure your application subscribes to this
  event, otherwise troubleshooting issues will be difficult.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    To write local files (if you use <code>file://</code>), the system user that
    is owner of the media server process needs to have write permissions for the
    requested path. By default, this user is named '<code>kurento</code>'.
  </li>
  <li>
    To record through HTTP, the remote server must be accessible through the
    network, and also have the correct write permissions for the destination
    path.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The <strong>Media Profile</strong> is quite an important parameter, as it will
  determine whether the server needs to perform on-the-fly transcoding of the
  media. If the input stream codec if not compatible with the selected media
  profile, the media will be transcoded into a suitable format. This will result
  in a higher CPU load and will impact overall performance of the media server.
</p>
<p>
  For example: If your pipeline receives <b>VP8</b>-encoded video from WebRTC,
  and sends it to a RecorderEndpoint; depending on the format selected...
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    WEBM: The input codec is the same as the recording format, so no transcoding
    will take place.
  </li>
  <li>
    MP4: The media server will have to transcode from <b>VP8</b> to <b>H264</b>.
    This will raise the CPU load in the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    MKV: Again, video must be transcoded from <b>VP8</b> to <b>H264</b>, which
    means more CPU load.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  From this you can see how selecting the correct format for your application is
  a very important decision.
</p>
<p>
  Recording will start as soon as the user invokes the
  <code>record</code> method. The recorder will then store, in the location
  indicated, the media that the source is sending to the endpoint. If no media
  is being received, or no endpoint has been connected, then the destination
  will be empty. The recorder starts storing information into the file as soon
  as it gets it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Recording must be stopped</strong> when no more data should be stored.
  This can be with the <code>stopAndWait</code> method, which blocks and returns
  only after all the information was stored correctly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    If your output file is empty, this means that the recorder is waiting for
    input media.
  </strong>
  When another endpoint is connected to the recorder, by default both AUDIO and
  VIDEO media types are expected, unless specified otherwise when invoking the
  <code>connect</code> method. Failing to provide both types, will result in the
  RecorderEndpoint buffering the received media: it won't be written to the file
  until the recording is stopped. The recorder waits until all types of media
  start arriving, in order to synchronize them appropriately.
</p>
<p>
  The source endpoint can be hot-swapped while the recording is taking place.
  The recorded file will then contain different feeds. When switching video
  sources, if the new video has different size, the recorder will retain the
  size of the previous source. If the source is disconnected, the last frame
  recorded will be shown for the duration of the disconnection, or until the
  recording is stopped.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    It is recommended to start recording only after media arrives.
  </strong>
  For this, you may use the <code>MediaFlowInStateChange</code> and
  <code>MediaFlowOutStateChange</code>
  events of your endpoints, and synchronize the recording with the moment media
  comes into the Recorder. For example:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    When the remote video arrives to KMS, your WebRtcEndpoint will start
    generating packets into the Kurento Pipeline, and it will trigger a
    <code>MediaFlowOutStateChange</code> event.
  </li>
  <li>
    When video packets arrive from the WebRtcEndpoint to the RecorderEndpoint,
    the RecorderEndpoint will raise a <code>MediaFlowInStateChange</code> event.
  </li>
  <li>
    You should only start recording when RecorderEndpoint has notified a
    <code>MediaFlowInStateChange</code> for ALL streams (so, if you record
    AUDIO+VIDEO, your application must receive a
    <code>MediaFlowInStateChange</code> event for audio, and another
    <code>MediaFlowInStateChange</code> event for video).
  </li>
</ol>
