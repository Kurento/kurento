      "doc": "Control interface for Kurento WebRTC endpoint.
<p>
  This endpoint is one side of a peer-to-peer WebRTC communication, being the
  other peer a WebRTC capable browser -using the RTCPeerConnection API-, a
  native WebRTC app or even another Kurento Media Server.
</p>
<p>
  In order to establish a WebRTC communication, peers engage in an SDP
  negotiation process, where one of the peers (the offerer) sends an offer,
  while the other peer (the offeree) responds with an answer. This endpoint can
  function in both situations
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    As offerer: The negotiation process is initiated by the media server
    <ul>
      <li>
        KMS generates the SDP offer through the
        <code>generateOffer</code> method. This <i>offer</i> must then be sent
        to the remote peer (the offeree) through the signaling channel, for
        processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        The remote peer processes the <i>offer</i>, and generates an
        <i>answer</i>. The <i>answer</i> is sent back to the media server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon receiving the <i>answer</i>, the endpoint must invoke the
        <code>processAnswer</code> method.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    As offeree: The negotiation process is initiated by the remote peer
    <ul>
      <li>
        The remote peer, acting as offerer, generates an SDP <i>offer</i> and
        sends it to the WebRTC endpoint in Kurento.
      </li>
      <li>
        The endpoint will process the <i>offer</i> invoking the
        <code>processOffer</code> method. The result of this method will be a
        string, containing an SDP <i>answer</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The SDP <i>answer</i> must be sent back to the offerer, so it can be
        processed.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  SDPs are sent without ICE candidates, following the Trickle ICE optimization.
  Once the SDP negotiation is completed, both peers proceed with the ICE
  discovery process, intended to set up a bidirectional media connection. During
  this process, each peer
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Discovers ICE candidates for itself, containing pairs of IPs and ports.
  </li>
  <li>
    ICE candidates are sent via the signaling channel as they are discovered, to
    the remote peer for probing.
  </li>
  <li>
    ICE connectivity checks are run as soon as the new candidate description,
    from the remote peer, is available.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once a suitable pair of candidates (one for each peer) is discovered, the
  media session can start. The harvesting process in Kurento, begins with the
  invocation of the <code>gatherCandidates</code> method. Since the whole
  Trickle ICE purpose is to speed-up connectivity, candidates are generated
  asynchronously. Therefore, in order to capture the candidates, the user must
  subscribe to the event <code>IceCandidateFound</code>. It is important that
  the event listener is bound before invoking <code>gatherCandidates</code>,
  otherwise a suitable candidate might be lost, and connection might not be
  established.
</p>
<p>
  It's important to keep in mind that WebRTC connection is an asynchronous
  process, when designing interactions between different MediaElements. For
  example, it would be pointless to start recording before media is flowing. In
  order to be notified of state changes, the application can subscribe to events
  generated by the WebRtcEndpoint. Following is a full list of events generated
  by WebRtcEndpoint:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>IceComponentStateChange</code>: This event informs only about changes
    in the ICE connection state. Possible values are:
    <ul>
      <li><code>DISCONNECTED</code>: No activity scheduled</li>
      <li><code>GATHERING</code>: Gathering local candidates</li>
      <li><code>CONNECTING</code>: Establishing connectivity</li>
      <li><code>CONNECTED</code>: At least one working candidate pair</li>
      <li>
        <code>READY</code>: ICE concluded, candidate pair selection is now final
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>FAILED</code>: Connectivity checks have been completed, but media
        connection was not established
      </li>
    </ul>
    The transitions between states are covered in RFC5245. It could be said that
    it's network-only, as it only takes into account the state of the network
    connection, ignoring other higher level stuff, like DTLS handshake, RTCP
    flow, etc. This implies that, while the component state is
    <code>CONNECTED</code>, there might be no media flowing between the peers.
    This makes this event useful only to receive low-level information about the
    connection between peers. Even more, while other events might leave a
    graceful period of time before firing, this event fires immediately after
    the state change is detected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>IceCandidateFound</code>: Raised when a new candidate is discovered.
    ICE candidates must be sent to the remote peer of the connection. Failing to
    do so for some or all of the candidates might render the connection
    unusable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>IceGatheringDone</code>: Raised when the ICE harvesting process is
    completed. This means that all candidates have already been discovered.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>NewCandidatePairSelected</code>: Raised when a new ICE candidate pair
    gets selected. The pair contains both local and remote candidates being used
    for a component. This event can be raised during a media session, if a new
    pair of candidates with higher priority in the link are found.
  </li>
  <li><code>DataChannelOpen</code>: Raised when a data channel is open.</li>
  <li><code>DataChannelClose</code>: Raised when a data channel is closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Registering to any of above events requires the application to provide a
  callback function. Each event provides different information, so it is
  recommended to consult the signature of the event listeners.
</p>
<p>
  Flow control and congestion management is one of the most important features
  of WebRTC. WebRTC connections start with the lowest bandwidth configured and
  slowly ramps up to the maximum available bandwidth, or to the higher limit of
  the exploration range in case no bandwidth limitation is detected. Notice that
  WebRtcEndpoints in Kurento are designed in a way that multiple WebRTC
  connections fed by the same stream share quality. When a new connection is
  added, as it requires to start with low bandwidth, it will cause the rest of
  connections to experience a transient period of degraded quality, until it
  stabilizes its bitrate. This doesn't apply when transcoding is involved.
  Transcoders will adjust their output bitrate based in bandwidth requirements,
  but it won't affect the original stream. If an incoming WebRTC stream needs to
  be transcoded, for whatever reason, all WebRtcEndpoints fed from transcoder
  output will share a separate quality than the ones connected directly to the
  original stream.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the default <strong>VideoSendBandwidth</strong> range of the
  endpoint is a VERY conservative one, and leads to a low maximum video quality.
  Most applications will probably want to increase this to higher values such as
  2000 kbps (2 mbps).

  </strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Input bandwidth: Values used to inform remote peers about the bitrate that
    can be sent to this endpoint.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>MinVideoRecvBandwidth</strong>: Minimum input bitrate, requested
        from WebRTC senders with REMB (Default: 30 Kbps).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MaxAudioRecvBandwidth</strong> and
        <strong>MaxVideoRecvBandwidth</strong>: Maximum input bitrate, signaled
        in SDP Offers to WebRTC and RTP senders (Default: unlimited).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Output bandwidth: Values used to control bitrate of the video streams sent
    to remote peers. It is important to keep in mind that pushed bitrate depends
    on network and remote peer capabilities. Remote peers can also announce
    bandwidth limitation in their SDPs (through the
    <code>b={modifier}:{value}</code> attribute). Kurento will always enforce
    bitrate limitations specified by the remote peer over internal
    configurations.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>MinVideoSendBandwidth</strong>: REMB override of minimum bitrate
        sent to WebRTC receivers (Default: 100 Kbps).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MaxVideoSendBandwidth</strong>: REMB override of maximum bitrate
        sent to WebRTC receivers (Default: 500 Kbps).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>RembParams.rembOnConnect</strong>: Initial local REMB bandwidth
        estimation that gets propagated when a new endpoint is connected.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>
    All bandwidth control parameters must be changed before the SDP negotiation
    takes place, and can't be changed afterwards.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  DataChannels allow other media elements that make use of the DataPad, to send
  arbitrary data. For instance, if there is a filter that publishes event
  information, it'll be sent to the remote peer through the channel. There is no
  API available for programmers to make use of this feature in the
  WebRtcElement. DataChannels can be configured to provide the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reliable or partially reliable delivery of sent messages</li>
  <li>In-order or out-of-order delivery of sent messages</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Unreliable, out-of-order delivery is equivalent to raw UDP semantics. The
  message may make it, or it may not, and order is not important. However, the
  channel can be configured to be <i>partially reliable</i> by specifying the
  maximum number of retransmissions or setting a time limit for retransmissions:
  the WebRTC stack will handle the acknowledgments and timeouts.
</p>
<p>
  The possibility to create DataChannels in a WebRtcEndpoint must be explicitly
  enabled when creating the endpoint, as this feature is disabled by default. If
  this is the case, they can be created invoking the createDataChannel method.
  The arguments for this method, all of them optional, provide the necessary
  configuration:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>label</code>: assigns a label to the DataChannel. This can help
    identify each possible channel separately.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>ordered</code>: specifies if the DataChannel guarantees order, which
    is the default mode. If maxPacketLifetime and maxRetransmits have not been
    set, this enables reliable mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>maxPacketLifeTime</code>: The time window in milliseconds, during
    which transmissions and retransmissions may take place in unreliable mode.
    This forces unreliable mode, even if <code>ordered</code> has been
    activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>maxRetransmits</code>: maximum number of retransmissions that are
    attempted in unreliable mode. This forces unreliable mode, even if
    <code>ordered</code> has been activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Protocol</code>: Name of the subprotocol used for data communication.

  If you know which network interfaces should be used to perform ICE (for WebRTC
  connectivity), you can define them here. Doing so has several advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The WebRTC ICE gathering process will be much quicker. Normally, it needs to
    gather local candidates for all of the network interfaces, but this step can
    be made faster if you limit it to only the interface that you know will
    work.

    It will ensure that the media server always decides to use the correct
