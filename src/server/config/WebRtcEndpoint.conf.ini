;; External IP addresses.
;;
;; If you know what will be the external or public IP address of the media
;; server (e.g. because your deployment has an static IP), you can specify it
;; here. Doing so has several advantages:
;;
;; 1. The WebRTC ICE gathering process will be much quicker. Normally, it needs
;;    to gather local IP addresses, but this step can be skipped if you provide
;;    them beforehand.
;;
;; 2. It will ensure that the media server always decides to use the correct
;;    network interface. With WebRTC ICE gathering it's possible that, under
;;    some circumstances (in systems with virtual network interfaces such as
;;    "docker0") the ICE process ends up choosing the wrong local IP.
;;
;; 3. You will not need to configure STUN/TURN for the media server. STUN/TURN
;;    are needed only when the media server needs to find out what is its own
;;    external IP. If you set it up here, then there is no need for the
;;    STUN/TURN auto-discovery.
;;
;; <externalAddresses> is a comma-separated list of IP addresses; domain names
;; are NOT supported.
;;
;; Examples:
;; externalAddresses=1.1.1.1
;; externalAddresses=1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3
;;
;externalAddresses=127.0.0.1

;; STUN server IP address.
;;
;; The ICE process uses STUN to punch holes through NAT firewalls.
;;
;; <stunServerAddress> MUST be an IP address; domain names are NOT supported.
;;
;; You need to use a well-working STUN server. Use this to check if it works:
;; https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
;;
;; From that check, you should get at least one Server-Reflexive Candidate
;; (type "srflx").
;;
;stunServerAddress=127.0.0.1
;stunServerPort=3478

;; TURN server URL.
;;
;; When STUN is not enough to open connections through some NAT firewalls,
;; using TURN is the remaining alternative.
;;
;; Note that TURN is a superset of STUN, so you don't need to configure STUN
;; if you are using TURN.
;;
;; The provided URL should follow one of these formats:
;;
;;   * user:password@ipaddress:port
;;   * user:password@ipaddress:port?transport=[udp|tcp|tls]
;;
;; <ipaddress> MUST be an IP address; domain names are NOT supported.
;; <transport> is OPTIONAL. Possible values: udp, tcp, tls. Default: udp.
;;
;; You need to use a well-working TURN server. Use this to check if it works:
;; https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
;;
;; From that check, you should get at least one Server-Reflexive Candidate
;; (type "srflx") AND one Relay Candidate (type "relay").
