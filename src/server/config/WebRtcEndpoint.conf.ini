;; Local network interfaces used for ICE gathering.
;;
;; If you know which network interfaces should be used to perform ICE (for
;; WebRTC connectivity), you can define them here. Doing so has several
;; advantages:
;;
;; * The WebRTC ICE gathering process will be much quicker. Normally, it needs
;;   to gather local candidates for all of the network interfaces, but this step
;;   can be made faster if you limit it to only the interface that you know will
;;   work.
;;
;; * It will ensure that the media server always decides to use the correct
;;   network interface. With WebRTC ICE gathering it's possible that, under some
;;   circumstances (in systems with virtual network interfaces such as
;;   "docker0") the ICE process ends up choosing the wrong local IP.
;;
;; <networkInterfaces> is a comma-separated list of network interface names.
;;
;; Examples:
;; networkInterfaces=eth0
;; networkInterfaces=eth0,enp0s25
;;
;networkInterfaces=eth0

;; STUN server IP address.
;;
;; The ICE process uses STUN to punch holes through NAT firewalls.
;;
;; <stunServerAddress> MUST be an IP address; domain names are NOT supported.
;;
;; You need to use a well-working STUN server. Use this to check if it works:
;; https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
;;
;; From that check, you should get at least one Server-Reflexive Candidate
;; (type "srflx").
;;
;stunServerAddress=127.0.0.1
;stunServerPort=3478

;; TURN server URL.
;;
;; When STUN is not enough to open connections through some NAT firewalls,
;; using TURN is the remaining alternative.
;;
;; Note that TURN is a superset of STUN, so you don't need to configure STUN
;; if you are using TURN.
;;
;; The provided URL should follow one of these formats:
;;
;;   * user:password@ipaddress:port
;;   * user:password@ipaddress:port?transport=[udp|tcp|tls]
;;
;; <ipaddress> MUST be an IP address; domain names are NOT supported.
;; <transport> is OPTIONAL. Possible values: udp, tcp, tls. Default: udp.
;;
;; You need to use a well-working TURN server. Use this to check if it works:
;; https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
;;
;; From that check, you should get at least one Server-Reflexive Candidate
;; (type "srflx") AND one Relay Candidate (type "relay").
;;
;turnURL=user:password@127.0.0.1:3478?transport=udp

;; Certificate used for DTLS authentication.
;;
;; If you want KMS to use a specific certificate for DTLS, then provide it here.
;; You can provide both RSA or ECDSA files; the choice between them is done when
;; calling the WebRtcEndpoint constructor.
;;
;; If this setting isn't specified, a different set of self-signed certificates
;; is generated automatically for each WebRtcEndpoint instance.
;;
;; This setting can be helpful, for example, for situations where you have to
;; manage multiple media servers and want to make sure that all of them use the
;; same certificate. Some browsers, such as Firefox, require this in order to
;; allow multiple WebRTC connections from the same tab to different KMS.
;;
;; Absolute path to the concatenated certificate (chain) file(s) + private key,
;; in PEM format.
;pemCertificateRSA=/path/to/cert+key.pem
;pemCertificateECDSA=/path/to/cert+key.pem

;; External IP address of the media server.
;;
;; This setting is normally NOT needed. Only use it if you know what you're
;; doing, and understand 100% WHY you want it. For the majority of cases, you
;; should prefer configuring STUN or TURN servers over using this setting.
;;
;; This setting implements a hack that will mangle all local ICE candidates so
;; that their candidate address is replaced with the provided external address,
;; even for candidates of type 'host'. In doing so, this KMS will not need a
;; STUN or TURN server, but remote peers will still be able to contact it.
;;
;; You can try using this setting if KMS is deployed on a publicly accessible
;; server, without NAT, and with a static public IP address. But if it doesn't
;; work for you, just go back to using the STUN or TURN settings above.
;;
;; <externalAddress> is an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
;;
;; Examples:
;; externalAddress=10.20.30.40
;; externalAddress=2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
;;
;externalAddress=10.20.30.40
